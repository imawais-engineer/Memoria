> A production‑grade MemoryAgent that remembers, forgets, resolves conflicts, and reflects on user knowledge – built on Qwen Cloud.

**Track:** Track 1 – MemoryAgent

**Live demo:** [http://20.219.193.66](http://20.219.193.66)

---

## Features

- **Persistent memory** – facts extracted from conversations are embedded (`text-embedding-v3`, 1024-dim) and stored in PostgreSQL + pgvector. Six memory types: `core`, `episodic`, `semantic`, `procedural`, `goal`, `preference`.
- **Cross‑session recall** – retrieve what you told the agent in earlier, separate sessions via hybrid ranking (vector similarity × importance × recency).
- **Personal Intelligence (PI)** – toggle global memory access across all chats, or limit recall to the current session + core facts when OFF.
- **MemoryLess incognito sessions** – private chats that never read or write long-term memory; media slash commands disabled.
- **Slash commands** – `/imagine`, `/gen_video`, `/gen_voice`, `/memorize`, `/create_task`, `/tasks_list`, `/task_complete`, `/list_memory`, `/forget_memory`; type `/` in chat for a formatted help table.
- **SSE streaming chat** – token-by-token replies via `POST /chat/stream` with Markdown + KaTeX rendering.
- **Tasks & media library** – create tasks in chat; browse generated images/videos with download and permanent delete.
- **Product knowledge base** – the AI carries a built-in reference of Memoria's architecture, features, and behaviour (`backend/app/services/memoria_knowledge.py`).
- **MCP skills** – expose memory tools (`get_core_memories`, `get_user_preferences`, `forget_memory`, `strengthen_memory`) at `GET /mcp/memory-skills` for external agents.
- **Autonomous forgetting & consolidation** – daily exponential decay archives stale memories; weekly Qwen‑Max clustering consolidates related facts into concise summaries.
- **Conflict detection** – new facts that contradict stored memories are flagged and superseded automatically during ingestion.
- **Reflective insights** – periodic Qwen reflection surfaces higher‑level patterns about the user and injects them into the system prompt.
- **Thumbs‑up/down feedback** – rate assistant replies to strengthen or weaken the memories that informed them (`POST /api/feedback`).
- **Structured output** – Qwen structured JSON responses power consolidation, reflection, and conflict resolution with schema fallbacks.
- **Benchmark‑proven 77.6% improvement** – 12‑scenario evaluation shows memory‑augmented replies score **77.6% higher** on average (see [Benchmark](#benchmark) below).
- **Markdown + LaTeX chat rendering** – assistant replies render rich Markdown and KaTeX math (`$...$`, `$$...$$`) in the dashboard.
- **Multimodal generation in chat** – use `/imagine`, `/gen_video`, and `/gen_voice` slash commands in chat for inline images (`wan2.1-t2i-plus`), videos (`wan2.1-t2v-turbo`), and voice overviews (Qwen summary + `qwen3-tts-flash`). All media uses DashScope default settings (no per-user size/duration controls). Per-user quotas (reset on upgrade): **10 chat messages**, **5 images**, **2 videos**, **2 voice generations**; exceeding a limit returns HTTP 429.
- **Chat model switcher** – choose among `qwen-plus`, `qwen-max`, `qwq-plus`, and `qwen-turbo` per session via `GET /api/models` and the chat composer dropdown.
- **Unified dark dashboard** – public landing page at `/`, auth at `/auth`, full app at `/app` with high-contrast typography and consistent blue→green accent gradient.
- **Deployment on Azure + Alibaba Cloud Terraform proof** – live instance on Azure; full stack IaC for Alibaba Cloud in [`infrastructure/acs_deployment.tf`](infrastructure/acs_deployment.tf).

## Architecture

Memoria is a modular FastAPI backend plus a React dashboard:

- A chat turn hits **`POST /chat`** or **`POST /chat/stream`**, which loads the short‑term **Redis** session, retrieves relevant long‑term memories from **PostgreSQL + pgvector** (scoped by Personal Intelligence / MemoryLess), and asks **Qwen (DashScope)** for a reply.
- New facts are extracted asynchronously by a **Celery** worker (Qwen function calling), embedded, and stored — with conflict detection and supersession.
- Scheduled **Celery Beat** jobs handle **decay** (daily 03:00 UTC) and **consolidation** (weekly Sun 04:00 UTC).
- Reflection runs in the background every 10th user message; MCP tools let external agents query and curate memory.

See the full component breakdown, sequence flows, and Mermaid diagram in **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Quick start

### 1. Clone & configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imawais-engineer/Memoria.git
cd Memoria
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — set DASHSCOPE_API_KEY (and DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL if using the
# international DashScope endpoint, e.g. https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v1)
```

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all supported variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `DEMO_API_TOKEN`, etc.).

### 2a. Run with Docker Compose (backend + Postgres/pgvector + Redis + workers)

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head   # apply DB migrations
# backend now on http://localhost:8000  (health: /health, docs: /docs)
```

> **⚠️ Data persistence — read this before updating**
>
> PostgreSQL data is stored in the named Docker volume `pgdata`. Redis chat
> session history is stored on the `redisdata` volume (persisted across standard
> restarts and upgrades). **Never use `docker compose down -v`** — the `-v`
> flag deletes volumes and will erase all memories, chats, and media.
>
> To update safely, keep your data and restart:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
> docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head
> ```

Then start the dashboard:

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** — you'll see the Memoria **landing page** at `/`. Click **Get Started** to open `/auth`, then sign up or log in (username + favorite book). After login you're taken to `/app` with a **fresh blank chat**; past sessions appear under **Recent Chats** in the sidebar.

### 2c. Alibaba Cloud ECS (production)

Terraform in [`infrastructure/acs_deployment.tf`](infrastructure/acs_deployment.tf) provisions ECS,
ApsaraDB PostgreSQL (pgvector), and ApsaraDB Redis. The ECS host runs the backend
via Docker Compose; **database state lives in ApsaraDB**, not on the container
filesystem.

When updating the app on ECS:

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head
```

**Never use `docker compose down -v` on any environment** — on local Compose it
deletes the `pgdata` volume (all memories, chats, and media). On ECS, avoid any
workflow that recreates managed databases from scratch unless you intend a full
reset.

**Dashboard views:** Chat · Memories · Persona · Tasks · Media · Settings · Help · Feedback · About (via profile menu).

Use **New Chat** and the **Memoryless** toggle (below it on empty chats) for session modes. In chat, try `/imagine`, `/gen_video`, or `/gen_voice` for inline media; type `/` for the command help table. The composer includes a **model switcher** (`qwen-plus`, `qwen-max`, `qwq-plus`, `qwen-turbo`) and a **Personal Intelligence** toggle.

### 2b. Run locally (without Docker)

Requires Python 3.12, Node 18+, PostgreSQL 16 with the `pgvector` extension, and Redis.

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload           # http://localhost:8000

# Background workers (separate shells, from backend/)
celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
celery -A celery_app beat   --loglevel=info

# Frontend (separate shell)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

## Benchmark

Memoria ships a reproducible benchmark suite (`scripts/benchmark.py`) that compares Qwen replies **with** vs **without** injected user memories across 12 realistic scenarios (dietary restrictions, allergies, preferences, goals).

| Metric | Without memory | With memory |
|---|---:|---:|
| Average accuracy | 0.58 | **0.90** |
| Average composite score (accuracy + safety + coherence) | 0.64 | **0.92** |
| Average improvement | — | **+77.6%** |

| Scenario | Improvement |
|---|---:|
| Recommend a restaurant for Friday dinner | +211% |
| What should I cook tonight? | +100% |
| Plan a healthy lunch for tomorrow | +58% |
| Help me choose a meal prep plan for the week | +460% |
| What should I do on a rainy Saturday? | +42% |
| *(7 more scenarios in results file)* | varies |

Full results: [`scripts/benchmark_results.json`](scripts/benchmark_results.json). Re‑run with:

```bash
cd backend && python ../scripts/benchmark.py
```

### End-to-end verification

After migrations and with PostgreSQL, Redis, the API server, and a Celery worker running:

```bash
python scripts/e2e_verification.py
```

The script signs up a test user, exercises chat/memory, Personal Intelligence toggles, `/imagine` / `/gen_video` / `/gen_voice` quotas, memorize, tasks, and memory deletion, then prints a pass/fail summary. Set `MEMORIA_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`) and `DATABASE_URL` if needed; media steps require `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`.
